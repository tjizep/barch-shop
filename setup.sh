# --- the space fetches an image it does not have, once -------------------
# `fs_source` names a stored function that produces a file by path; the route that
# serves them opts in with `source = true`. A missing one is remembered for
# missing_ttl so a 404 is not a round trip every time
# --- how many shards each space is cut into -------------------------------
# 7, not the 347 a space takes by default. The floor is
# `shards x arenas x page_size`, and at a 512 KiB page that is 347 MB per space
# before a single key exists - measured at 837 MB on disk and 895 MB RSS for
# 29 MB of real data across these five spaces. memtier says the throughput
# difference is 0.1%, inside the run to run spread, so the 347 is paying six to
# nine times the memory for nothing here. See TODO 314.
#
# This has to be set before the space is first used, because that is when it is
# built. And it cannot be changed on a store that already exists: a space saved
# with one count and loaded with another comes up with most of its keys
# unreachable, so barch refuses to load it and says so. Starting the shop over
# means stopping the server and deleting data/, as the README says.
