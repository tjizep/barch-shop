# A shop, out of a key space

A working web shop over 7,344 Amazon products: categories, search, product pages, a
basket and a checkout. All of it runs inside [barch](https://github.com/tjizep/barch),
with no other database, web server or app server.

## See it running

### What you need first

Three programs: `barchd` (barch itself), `python3` and `redis-cli`. Check you have
them by pasting this into a terminal:

```
barchd --version; python3 --version; redis-cli --version
```

Each should print a version. If `barchd` says "command not found", build or install
it first, following [barch's README](https://github.com/tjizep/barch). If
`redis-cli` is missing, on Ubuntu or Debian it comes with
`sudo apt install redis-tools`.

### Start the shop

Open **two terminal windows**. Everything goes in a folder called
`~/barch-shop-demo`, so it doesn't matter which folder each terminal starts in.

**In terminal 1**, paste this and leave it running. It starts barch, which downloads
the shop from GitHub and installs it:

```
mkdir -p ~/barch-shop-demo/data && cd ~/barch-shop-demo && barchd --port 14000 --dir data -g https://github.com/tjizep/barch-shop user=default
```

**In terminal 2**, paste this. It waits until terminal 1 is ready, then loads the
7,344 products. It takes from a few seconds to a minute, depending on how quickly
terminal 1 downloads the shop, and ends with `loaded 7344 products into inventory`:

```
until redis-cli -p 14000 ping >/dev/null 2>&1; do sleep 1; done; cd ~/barch-shop-demo/data/functions/barch-shop && python3 prepare.py && python3 load_inventory.py 14000
```

**Then open http://127.0.0.1:18090/shop in your browser.**

Pictures show up as you scroll. Each one is fetched from Amazon the first time anyone
looks at it, so this needs internet access.

### Stopping it, and next time

- **To stop the shop**, press `Ctrl+C` in terminal 1. Terminal 2 has already
  finished and can be closed.
- **To start it again later**, you only need terminal 1's command. The products are
  saved, so terminal 2 isn't needed a second time.
- **To start over from nothing**, stop the shop, then run
  `rm -rf ~/barch-shop-demo` and do both steps again.

If the page opens but shows no products, terminal 2's command didn't finish. Run it
again and read what it prints.

### Extras

- **The key space viewer**, a page that shows everything stored in barch. Stop the
  shop, then start it in terminal 1 with this instead:

  ```
  cd ~/barch-shop-demo && barchd --port 14000 --dir data -g https://github.com/tjizep/barch-shop user=default -g https://github.com/tjizep/barch-spaces user=default
  ```

  and open http://127.0.0.1:18091/spaces.
- **Address lookup at checkout.** With the shop running, paste this into terminal 2.
  It downloads map data and takes about six minutes; without it the checkout just
  says there's no address data:

  ```
  cd ~/barch-shop-demo/data/functions/barch-shop && pip install overturemaps h3 redis shapely && python3 geo.py --port 14000
  ```

## How it's put together

The catalog is a file tree in barch whose directories are the category tree. The
product images aren't shipped at all: they arrive from Amazon the first time somebody
looks at one. The rest of this README goes through each part, and "Things it ran into"
at the end lists what went wrong on the way.

## Running it from a clone, with setup.sh

From a clone of this repository, `setup.sh` does all of it:

```
mkdir -p data
barchd --port 14000 --dir data --config internal_shards=7 &
PORT=14000 HTTP_PORT=18090 ./setup.sh
# open http://127.0.0.1:18090/shop
```

`prepare.py` turns `shopping/amazon-products.csv` into `build/`, and `setup.sh`
loads it, and the images arrive as you browse. The checkout's address lookup wants
one more step, because that data is pulled rather than shipped:

```
pip install overturemaps h3 redis shapely
python3 geo.py --port 14000
```

About six minutes. Skip it and the checkout says so rather than offering a picker
that finds nothing.

`--dir` is what keeps `data/` in that first line worth typing. barch writes its
shards to the working directory, so a bare `barchd --port 14000` started here
leaves its `leaves_*.dat` and `nodes_*.dat` files next to `setup.sh` and the
example becomes hard to read. `--dir` chdirs first, so they all land under
`data/`. It does not create the directory, hence the `mkdir`. Both `data/` and
`build/` are gitignored; deleting `data/` with the server stopped is how you
start the shop over from nothing.

`--config internal_shards=7` is the other half of keeping `data/` small, and
`setup.sh` sets `<space>.shards 7` for each of the five spaces beside it. A
space defaults to 347 shards, and the floor is `shards x arenas x page_size` -
at a 512 KiB page that is 347 MB *per space* before a single key exists. Left at
the default this example measured 837 MB on disk and 895 MB resident for 29 MB
of actual data; at 7 it is a few tens of MB. memtier puts the throughput
difference at 0.1%, inside the run to run spread, so the 347 was buying nothing
here.

Two things follow from that. The shard count has to be set before a space is
first used, because that is when it is built - which is why those `SET`s come
first in `setup.sh`. And it cannot be changed on a store that already exists: a
space saved with one count and loaded with another would come up with most of
its keys unreachable, so barch refuses to load it and says which count it was
saved with. If you have a `data/` from before this change, stop the server and
delete it.

## Or straight from git, with package.luau

`package.luau` says the same things as `setup.sh`, as data: the spaces and their
settings, which folder goes into which space, and the HTTP server. barchd installs
it on startup from this repository:

```
barchd --port 14000 --dir data -g https://github.com/tjizep/barch-shop user=default
```

Each sync applies it in order: settings first, so a space opens with its shard
count, then the folders, then HTTP. The server comes back after a restart, which
`setup.sh` alone doesn't give you.

Accounts isn't in this folder any more. It's a repository of its own,
[github.com/tjizep/barch-accounts](https://github.com/tjizep/barch-accounts), that
other apps can use too, and the package pulls it in with `depends` into
`users:/modules`, where `shopapi.luau` requires it from. A dependency is the
server cloning a url the repository chose, so like the hook below it only happens
when the repository has a `user`.

The one step that isn't data is the grant `web` needs, so that's the package's
after hook, `hooks/shopgrants.luau`. Hooks run as the repository's `user`, which
you choose on the command line. With no `user` they're skipped, so a repository
can't grant itself rights. The catalog is still `prepare.py` and
`load_inventory.py` against the running server: until then `/shop` loads and
`/api/index` says the catalog isn't loaded.

  build/                what prepare.py writes, loaded by setup.sh
  data/                 where barchd keeps its shards
```

The five module directories are the shape of the thing: each one is loaded into
the key space whose data it reads, so the code for an account is in `users` beside
the accounts, the code for a review is in `ratings` beside the reviews, the street
lookup is in `geo` beside the streets and the order code is in `orders` beside the
orders. Only `modules/` belongs to `shop`, because the catalog does.

`shop.css` is one stylesheet for all three pages rather than a `<style>` block in
each, which is what they had. It takes its colours and type from `docs/index.html`
- ink and paper greys, cobalt for the thing you click, copper for the accent, IBM
Plex Sans with Archivo for display and JetBrains Mono for the small uppercase
labels - so the shop and the documentation read as one project. The layout is an
ordinary storefront: a white two row header over a grey ground, a sidebar card of
categories, flat product cards with a hairline instead of a shadow, and a dark
full width button at the bottom of each one. The `kind = "files"` route serves it
with the content type read off the extension, so nothing had to be configured for
a second file type.

## What is where

Five key spaces. `shop` holds the catalog:

| path | what |
|---|---|
| `/catalog/<top>/<sub>/<asin>.json` | the full record. **The directories are the category tree** |
| `/meta/index.json` | one compact row per product, so the front page is one read |
| `/meta/names.json` | slug to display name |
| `/modules/catalog.luau` | the lookup the API and the source share, loaded with `require` |
| `/app/index.html` | the storefront, with `register.html` and `signon.html` beside it |
| `where:<asin>` | which catalog path an asin was found at, remembered after the first walk |

and four stored functions: `CONF` (the http key), `SHOPUI` (`kind = "files"`, the
page), `SHOPAPI` (`/api/*`), and `SHOPIMG` (`/img/*`, a files route with a source).

`users` holds the accounts:

| path | what |
|---|---|
| `user:<email>` | `{email, name, salt, hash}` - the account |
| `sess:<sid>` | the email a signed-in cookie belongs to |
| `/modules/accounts.luau` | register, signon, signout, and reading the sid cookie |
| `/modules/sha256.luau` | the password hash, since the sandbox has no crypto |

and `ratings` holds what shoppers said:

| path | what |
|---|---|
| `rating:<asin>:<email>` | `{asin, email, name, stars, comment, seq}` - one per account per product |
| `ratingcount:<asin>` / `ratingsum:<asin>` | the totals, so an average is two reads |
| `/modules/ratings.luau` | `GET` and `POST /api/ratings` |

and `geo` holds the places the checkout's address step looks up:

| path | what |
|---|---|
| `street:<NAME>:<METRO>` | `{name, metro, ways, lat, lon}` - one per distinct road name per metro |
| `sub:<NAME>:<KIND>:<id>` | `{name, kind, lat, lon}` - suburbs, cities, municipalities |
| `prov:<NAME>` | the nine provinces |
| `meta:loaded` | what `geo.py` loaded, and when |
| `/modules/geo.luau` | the lookup behind `GET /api/places` |

and `orders` holds what checkout wrote:

| path | what |
|---|---|
| `order:<id>` | the document, priced on the server |
| `byuser:<email>:<seq>` | the id, so one customer's orders are one walk |
| `/modules/orders.luau` | placing them, and `GET /api/orders` |

None of those four has a stored function or a route of its own. Every route is
in `shop`, because that is the space the HTTP server runs in, and it reaches the
others with `require("users:/modules/accounts.luau")` for the code and
`barch.space.users` for the data. What moved is where the code and the data are
kept, not where either runs - the sections below are about why, and about what it
costs.

`GET /api/categories` has no index behind it: it is `fs.list("/catalog")` and then
`fs.list` on each of those. The tree on disk *is* the answer.

## Images arrive as they are asked for, into `images`

The catalog holds urls, not pictures - a 40 image sample averages 33kB, so the whole
of it is somewhere around 250MB, and there is no reason to hold any of that until
somebody looks at one. Pictures have a key space of their own, `images`, and they are
**files** there (`/img/<asin>`), not keys: a key tops out at 512 kB and a picture may
not. (It was keys for a while, behind a luau handler, which also cost a VM slot per
fetch and needed the `web` user to have `+outbound`.)

`/img/<asin>` is a **files route** with `space = "images"`, so it serves that space's
file store rather than the server's own, and `source = true`, so the space fetches
what it does not have. That is `images.fs_source`, a stored function **in the images
space** - `images/luau/imgsource.luau`, loaded by `setup.sh` with `LOADKEYS` (a
reload does not push `images/luau`; load it by hand after editing). It turns
`/img/<asin>` into a lookup in `inventory` and one `http.request`, and returns
`{body, type}`. Measured here: about 1s cold, 0.6ms warm, and a product nobody sells
is a 404 remembered for `images.missing_ttl` rather than a round trip every time.

`FS LS /img SOURCE` lists the whole catalog, the fetched ones as `file` and the rest
as `remote`; that is `images.fs_source_list` (`imglist.luau`), a separate setting
because a file source answers `{body, type}` and a listing answers names.

Needs a `barchd` built after 18-09-2026. An older one ignores `space` and every
picture is a 404; `HTTP STATUS` ends the route's line with `space=images` when it is
understood.

`migrate_images.py` turned the pictures that had been keys into files. It leaves the
`i:` and `t:` keys where they were.

## Both ways of holding a catalog

The products are files here, which is what makes `fs.list` the category tree. The
same records work as plain keys - `prepare.py` writes one JSON per product and
`LOADKEYS build/catalog` would import them as `catalog:<top>:<sub>:<asin>.json`
instead. What that loses is the directory listing: a key namespace is walked with
`DIR LS ... SEP :`, which gives the same shape by a different route.

## Accounts, in a space of their own

`POST /api/register`, `POST /api/signon`, `POST /api/signout` and `GET /api/me`
add registration and sign-on, with a `/shop/register.html` and
`/shop/signon.html` page over them. What they store is deliberately **not**
in `shop`: a customer record is not catalog data, and this space has already
been dropped and reloaded more than once while getting the catalog right (see
the arena and re-import work in the history above) - an account must survive
that.

So accounts live in a second key space, `users`, and **so does the code that
reads them**: `accounts.luau`, from barch-accounts, is loaded into that space's file
store and `shopapi.luau` reaches it with
`require("users:/modules/accounts.luau")`. The four things in it are in
"What is where" above.

What moving the code does *not* move is where it runs. An HTTP route is a
stored function in the server's space and stays one, so a module required out
of `users` still has `barch.store` and `barch.call` pointing at `shop`.
Everything in `accounts.luau` therefore goes through the `barch.space.users`
handle, and a sibling require has to name the space again -
`require("users:/modules/sha256.luau")`, because a bare `:/...` resolves
against the running space rather than the space the file came out of.

Neither `require("users:...")` nor `barch.space.users` creates a space, so
`setup.sh` runs a bare `USE users` before the HTTP server starts - the same
way `USE` already brings `shop` and `configuration` into being - and then has
barch sync barch-accounts from GitHub into `users:/modules` as a git repository.

There is no crypto library in the Luau sandbox (`open_safe` in
`luau_driver.cpp` opens base, math, string, table, bit32, and the rest - no
hashing), so barch-accounts' `sha256.luau` is a pure-Luau SHA-256 over `bit32`,
and a password is stored as `sha256(salt .. password)` with an 8 byte random
salt per account. It is not a KDF and it is not constant time - fine for an
example storefront, not a reason to reuse it anywhere that has to resist a
real attacker.

Signing in sets an `sid` cookie the same way [`examples/http/luau/session.luau`](https://github.com/tjizep/barch/blob/main/examples/http/luau/session.luau) in barch
does, except the session points into `users` rather than into `barch.store`
on `shop` - a session is data about an account, and belongs with it.

`POST /api/send-email` is the shape a real deployment would want for a
welcome mail or a reset link, in `luau/sendemail.luau`: it validates
`{to, subject, ...}` and answers `{ok, queued}` without contacting any
provider. Wiring SMTP or a provider API in is future work; the point here is
the endpoint, not the delivery.

## The catalog, in `inventory`

Product data has its own key space, `inventory`, and `shop` keeps only what
serves the storefront: the stored functions, `/app`, `/modules` and the `/img`
picture cache. The catalog is plain keys there, not files:

| key | holds |
|---|---|
| `p:<asin>` | the full product record |
| `index:<n>`, `index:n` | the compact rows, 200 to a key without their brackets, and how many keys |
| `names` | slug to display name |
| `categories` | the whole category tree as JSON |

`load_inventory.py PORT` writes them from `build/`. The rows are chunked because
the whole 2.3 MB index is over the largest value one key can hold;
`modules/catalog.luau` joins the chunks back into the array `/api/index` serves.
`find(asin)` is now a single `GET`, so the old `where:<asin>` lookup cache is
gone. As with `users`, `barch.space.inventory` looks a space up and does not
create one, so `USE inventory` has to run before the HTTP server starts.

The file store no longer holds `/catalog` or `/meta`, so the category tree is a
stored key rather than the directory layout.

## Ratings, in a third space

`p.rating`/`p.reviews` on a product record are the Amazon numbers `prepare.py`
imported once and never change. What a shopper actually says on this
storefront is a separate thing, `POST /api/ratings` and `GET
/api/ratings/<asin>`, and it gets a key space of its own, `ratings` - a rating
is data about a product, not about an account, and it should not be dropped
with the catalog either. The code goes with it, the same way the accounts code
went to `users`. The three keys it holds are in "What is where" above.

Posting again on a product you already rated overwrites that one document
rather than adding a second line and keeps the sequence number it had, so an
edit does not jump to the top of the list.

**Two things had to change when this moved out of `shop`.** A space handle has
`get`, `set` and `range` and no `INCRBY`, and `barch.call` goes to the space
the *route* runs in - `shop` - so the counters cannot be bumped the way
`order:seq` a few lines up still is. Faking an increment with a get and a set
loses a vote when two people rate the same product at the same moment and then
drifts for good, so the totals are recomputed from the reviews that are
actually there and written back as a cache: one product's worth of walk, on a
write, never on a read, and a wrong total is corrected by the next one. The
per-product `ratingseq:<asin>` counter went the same way - the next sequence
number is the highest one in the walk plus one - so there is no counter key
left at all. There is still no clock in the Luau sandbox (`open_safe` opens no
`os` library), which is why "newest first" is a sequence number rather than a
timestamp.

And the review list was `DIR LS rating:<asin> SEP :`, which is a command and
so would have walked `shop`. It is the handle's `range` now, bounded
`rating:<asin>:` to `rating:<asin>;` - ':' is 0x3a and ';' is 0x3b, so the half
open bound picks up exactly this product's keys. Underneath it is
`text_range`, which reads the composite region as well as the plain one, so
the TODO 260 problem - a key with a space in it living in another region of
the tree - does not come back.

Rating a product requires being signed in, the same `sid` cookie `/api/me`
reads. `shopapi.luau` resolves the shopper through the accounts module and
hands the ratings module `{email, name}` plus a "does this asin exist"
function, because the ratings space holds opinions about asins and no catalog
to check them against.

Building this turned up a real bug in `barch.space`, TODO 273: the handle held
a pointer into a dense map, so opening the second space moved the first one's
entry and the next read through it died with `bad_function_call`. Three lines
reproduce it and the fix is to hold those entries by pointer.

## Checkout, in three steps

`POST /api/order` used to take a name, an email and an address as one line of
free text, out of a form at the bottom of the basket. It is a flow now - basket,
delivery, payment - in the one panel, because the basket has to stay visible
while somebody is correcting an address.

The step is state and not a route: nothing in it is worth a URL. What does
outlive a reload is the address and the payment choice, in `localStorage`; the
step itself does not, because coming back to a payment screen with no memory of
why is worse than starting again.

**The delivery step looks streets and suburbs up as you type**, out of `geo`,
debounced at 160ms. What it does not do is ask you to pick a house number,
because that data does not exist - see below.

The apartment number comes first and on its own, and the street line is written
the way people write it: `12 Long Street`. There is no street called "12 Long", so
a leading run of digits is split off and only what follows is searched - and while
the line is still just a number there is nothing to look for, so nothing is asked
for. Picking from the list keeps the number that was already typed, which is why
the split is a parse rather than a second field. The order keeps both: `line` as
typed for anything printing a label, `house` and `street` beside it for anything
counting streets, because neither is recoverable from the other for free.

**The payment step offers methods and never asks for a card number.** Cash on
delivery, card on delivery, EFT. An example storefront has no business
collecting a card number, and a demo that puts a PAN field on the screen teaches
the wrong thing to whoever copies it. The order records `{method, state}` and
there is nothing else to store or to leak. The server checks the method against
the same three it offers, for the same reason it prices the basket itself: a
request that arrives with its own payment method is a request that can arrive
with any of them.

## The account screen, and where orders live

Signing in used to get you a button that signed you back out. There is an account
behind it now - who you are, your orders newest first with their state, and sign
out - and the header carries a count of what is still pending.

`GET /api/orders` reads the email off the session and never off the query string,
so there is no version of it that lists somebody else's. `GET /api/orders/<id>`
checks the id against the caller's own index rather than trusting it, because
knowing an order id should not be the same as being allowed to read it. Asked for
one that is not yours, the answer is the same 404 as one that does not exist.

**Orders moved out of `shop` while this was built, and that is the interesting
part.** They were sitting next to the catalog, which is exactly what this README
spends two sections arguing accounts should not do - and dropping the catalog to
clear a stale import during this work took every order with it while `users` and
`ratings` came through. An order has to outlive the catalog for the same reason an
account does, so it lives in `orders` with the code that reads it.

The id allocator had to move too, and could not move as it was. It was
`INCRBY order:seq`, and `barch.call` runs against the space the *route* is in -
`shop` - so the counter would have stayed with the catalog and a reload would
reset it and start handing out ids that already existed. It is sixteen hex
characters out of `math.random` now, which needs nothing kept anywhere. The
per-customer sequence in `byuser:<email>:<seq>` is the same trick the ratings use:
no INCRBY to reach, so the next one is the highest already there plus one, over
the handful of orders one account has.

Checked the way the argument says to check it: place three orders, `FLUSHDB` the
`shop` space down to zero keys, reload the catalog with `setup.sh`, and the three
orders and the session are still there with `shop` holding no `order:*` at all.

Nothing in this example fulfils an order, so every order is `pending`. The field
is there because an order without a state is not an order, and because the
account screen has to show something true.

## Places, and the address data South Africa does not have

[`examples/flask/overture.py`](https://github.com/tjizep/barch/blob/main/examples/flask/overture.py) in barch loads Overture's `address` theme for Canada - full
addresses, house numbers, postcodes - across nine key spaces. Neither half of
that carries over.

**Overture has no South African addresses.** The `address` theme is
OpenAddresses derived and the country is not in it: Cape Town, Johannesburg,
Pretoria and Durban bounding boxes each answer zero rows. What does have
coverage, both out of OpenStreetMap, is `division` - suburbs, cities, provinces -
and `segment`, which carries named roads. So `geo.py` loads those two, and the
checkout asks for the house number and the postal code as typed text. A picker
that pretended to know South African house numbers would be worse than a field
that admits it does not.

**One key space, not nine.** Nine is what you do when a point lookup and a prefix
walk want different structures - `streets` for the text, `spatial_data` for the
records, `tokey` to get between them, `overflows` because an appended list fills
up. Hybrid keys remove the reason: the ART owns the leaves and a hash indexes
them, so one ordered space answers both. The only design left is that the text
you search by has to lead the key, which is why they read
`street:<NAME>:<METRO>` and not `street:<METRO>:<NAME>`.

Measured on the loaded space - 88,009 keys, `INFO SHARD` reporting
`index_physical:ART+HASH`:

| read | |
|---|---|
| exact key, the hash hit | 32us |
| three letter prefix, 25 results | 1.2ms |
| one letter prefix, 25 results | 1.7ms |

Those are round trips over RESP, so the 32us is mostly the trip rather than the
read. The point is the shape: the same space does both, and neither one needed a
second copy of the data.

What `geo.py` pulls by default is every division in the country and the named
roads of four metros - Cape Town, Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban - which is
12,138 places and 75,865 street names in about six minutes. `--all-roads` is the
national version and takes hours. The roads are folded to one key per name per
metro as they load, since a road is many segments and the picker wants a name:
238,525 Cape Town segments become 24,472 streets.

## Looking at the key spaces

The shop used to carry its own key space viewer. It's a repository of its own now,
[barch-spaces](https://github.com/tjizep/barch-spaces), that works beside any app.
To see what the shop keeps, give barchd both:

```
barchd --port 14000 --dir data \
  -g https://github.com/tjizep/barch-shop user=default \
  -g https://github.com/tjizep/barch-spaces user=default
# the shop: http://127.0.0.1:18090/shop    the viewer: http://127.0.0.1:18091/spaces
```

It shows every space with its keys and values, the file store, the functions and
the settings, and lets an admin change them and run commands. It has its own
accounts, separate from the shop's, and the first one made becomes its admin. Its
README says what it grants the `web` user the shop's routes also run as.

## Things it ran into

**Nine categories with nothing in them** (TODO 279, and not a bug). `LOADFS`
adds and overwrites and never deletes, so a space that was loaded from a larger
catalog keeps the directories the new one does not have - and `GET
/api/categories` is `fs.list`, so it reported them honestly. The empty entries
were real entries. Nothing about the route or the import is wrong: an import is
additive on purpose, because a flag that deleted files because a directory did
not have them would take a tree with it the first time somebody typed the wrong
root. To make this space match `build/` again, empty it and load it: `FLUSHDB`
on `shop`, or stop the server and remove `data/*shop*.dat`, then run `setup.sh`.
Doing that leaves `users` and `ratings` alone, which is the argument for them
being separate spaces, made by accident.

**A key with a space in it was invisible to a range scan** (TODO 260, since
fixed). The first version used category names as directory names, so
`/catalog/Home & Kitchen/...` stored 992 files - the catalog was smaller then - of
which a listing found three. The
key had a space, which made it a composite in another region of the tree, and the
scan only asked one region. A range bounds both now and `FS LS` on those same
directories returns all 28. The paths stay slugged anyway, because
`home-kitchen` is a better thing to put in a url than `Home & Kitchen`.

**`barch.call` returned a bulk string with its RESP type byte attached** (TODO 261,
since fixed) - `$hello`, not `hello`. The record came back beginning `${"asin":` and
`simdjson.parse` was quite right to refuse it. `barch.call("CALLF", ...)` works now;
the shared lookup stays a `require`d module because one copy of it in a file both
routes read is the better arrangement anyway.

**A `require` at the top of a file fails at install.** Storing a function runs the
chunk, and at that moment there is no store for `require` to read a module out of.
So the requires are inside the handlers, where they cost one lookup per session
because `require` caches.

**Prices are server side.** The basket posts asins and quantities, never prices;
`/api/order` looks each one up and totals it. A basket that arrives with its own
totals is a basket that can arrive with any totals it likes.
